      <h1>Welcome to Perth!</h1>
      <p>Located in the heart of Scotland the city of Perth has something for everyone.
        <br>Whether it's the rich history, the beautiful countryside, or the vibrant city life there is plenty to experience in Perth.</p>
      <p>Known as "the gateway to the highlands" Perth's location on the banks of the river Tay leaves it just over an hours drive from both Glasgow and Edinburgh, and less than an hour to get into the beautiful Scottish Highlands.

      <p>Perth itself has much to offer. The city, home to almost 50,000 people, boasts a shopping centre, theatre, and cinema. The Blackwatch museum and Scone palace exemplify the cities deep roots in Scottish history. Outside the city there are countless opportunities for scenic walks and outdoor adventure.</p>
