    <h2>Prehistory</h2>

    <p>The area around the modern city of perth is known to have been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribes since the stone age.
      <br>Neolithic standing stones and stone circles found in the area have been dated to 4,000 BC, a period that followed the introduction of farming in the area.
      <br>The land around the river Tay proved perfect for these early farming communities, and the area has been inhabited ever since.</p>

    <h2>Scotland's First Capital</h2>

    <p>Perth played an important part in Scotland's early history.
      <br>The presence of the royal court in Scone, only 2 miles northeast of the city, enhanced Perth's early importance.
      <br>This period, starting from at least the 9th century with the rule of King Kenneth I, led to Perth being seen as the capital of Scotland during this time.</p>

    <p>Perth's importance continued in the 12th and 13th centuries, with the city being an important trading town, as well as being home to many craftsmen and guilds.
      <br>Perth was a hub for foreign trade, with goods being sold to many areas in Europe. Luxury goods were brought back, including Spanish silk and French pottery and wine.</p>

    <h2>The Stone of Destiny</h2>

    <p>The nearby  Scone palace served as the Scottish royal court for a long period of history. The stone of Scone, also known as "the Stone of Destiny", was an artifact that many Scottish kings were coronated on, including the likes of Macbeth and Robert the Bruce.
      <br>The stone was removed from Scone in 1296 when Perth was conquered by English forces. The stone was taken to England and placed in Westminster Abbey. Since then most British monarchs were crowned on the stone.
      <br>The stone was returned to Scotland in 1996, 700 years after it was taken. After a time in Edinburgh Castle the stone made it's way back to Perth, and now resides in the city's museum</p>

    <h2>Literature</h2>

    <p>Sir Walter Scott's novel "The Fair Maid of Perth" was published in 1828. The novel, set in Perth gave the city it's nickname of "The Fair City".</p>
